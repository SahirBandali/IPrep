0,Explain how hydraulics work on a machine,"Using a incompressible fluid machines use hydraulics to transmit force from one point to another. In most cases, this increases the force applied at one end for a given amount of effort."
1,What is a process flow diagram?,Commonly used in chemical and process engineering. A process flow diagram (PFD) is a diagram that is used to indicate the general flow of equipment and plant processes. 
2,What is the difference between a strut and a column?Â ,A Column is always vertical but a strut could carry an axial compressive load in any direction. A strut and column both carry the compressive load.
3,To increase the corrosion resistance of steel which elements do you need?,Chromium and nickel.

7,What is the second law of thermodynamics?,Thesecond law of thermodynamicsstates that total entropywill always increase within a closed system and can never decrease over time.
8,What is the process flow diagram?,A process flow diagram is a diagram commonly used in chemical and process engineering to indicate the general flow of plant processes and equipment.
9,Explain mechanical refrigeration,Using an artificial heat exchange system mechanical refrigeration is a process where heated is removed from a chosen location. 
10,Describe the difference between a tube and a pipe,"Pipes are always round while tubes can come in different shapes such as rectangular, square, or cylindrical. "
